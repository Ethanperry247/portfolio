Instead, I decided to contact the coordinator and talk with her about both my experience in the past and what I was looking for in the future. She told me that, after looking over my application, she thought my experience wasn’t well suited for the FIRST program, as I had learned many of the skills through a series of classes I took in high school. However (and very generously of her), she gave me an opportunity to be a part of the Mines Undergraduate Research Fellowship (MURF). The final application material was due the next day, so I quickly reached out and found a connection with Dr. Qi Han of the computer science department. I couldn’t be more glad, and I began doing research with her shortly after. My research, which focused on a subset of wireless communication algorithms called multicast routing algorithms, became a fantastic learning experience for me. I made great connections with my research partners, and (just about) solidified my aspirations to become a researcher and possibly a professor in the future. Dr. Han has been an astonishing research mentor and guide for my future career, and I hope to continue with her in the future.

I wanted to develop a useful and practical project, so I decided to go with a theme of using computer hardware and python software to improve fire detector systems. I ended up integrating wireless radio networks with fire detecting sensors, and my project was chosen for display at the CS@Mines Innovation Fair and the CS@Mines Industry Partner event. I displayed my project to judges and industry professionals, gaining some useful feedback on what my system could look like in the future and what it was lacking now. I compiled these ideas and have been continuing to work on the system as a part of an independent study project this semester.

I had been designing websites throughout the last semester for school, independent study, and work projects; accordingly, I thought that I may finally have the toolkit necessary to build my own site. So I decided to make it a challenge for myself--when I had the free time, I would hop on to my development environment, learn a new skill, apply that learned skill, and create a new feature on my website. I focused on reusability of my code, and tried to make it as aesthetically pleasing as I could. For the skills I was working with, I was pleased with the result, and I tried to follow as many professional standards as I could (though it is not perfect by any means). Nonetheless, it helped get me noticed by several employers, and indirectly helped lead to a new opportunity for me over the summer. I would like to iterate on this design once I have learned more, and the creation of the site (among other projects) interested me enough that I am registered for a web programming course next semester to continue developing my skills. This project really pushed me, as I was trying to use a relatively new web framework to build the site. In many ways, it gave me the courage to build this website. But I’ll save that for later in the tour…","url":["website.png","website2.png"],"modalTitle":"","modalBody":"","hasModal":false,"showLinks":false,"links":[{"name":"Portfolio Website","url":"https://ethanperry247.github.io/#/"}],"isQuote":false,"quoteBody":"","quoteAuthor":""},{"title":"","body":"","url":"","modalTitle":"Thinking About the Edge Cases","modalBody":"Another thing that IDEAS has taught me was the importance of thinking about tethers.

Considering that this idea is so tough to communicate, I can understand why it came across as confusing from the beginning--sometimes the reader doesn’t have the same context that the writer may have in their head while writing. This led to some gaps in knowledge and accordingly didn’t get our full idea across. After an attempt to fill those gaps, I believe it flows better and makes more sense in its revised state.","url":["brain.png","VR1.png"],"caption":"Developing a VR Application for Module 4","modalTitle":"","modalBody":"","hasModal":false,"showLinks":false,"links":[{"name":"Original","url":"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uMe6S1O46Kmo-Ie_AVN4Geq1cPMdG28eFfimZhMN2nA/edit?usp=sharing"},{"name":"With Revisions","url":"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1z1NzIw6j8Y3_t_KBXD-KpQYijv0DVyS9kFKuNaQK1So/edit?usp=sharing"},{"name":"Final","url":"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Wu5rTK2pce3upxR03HmREALA0K9AeCXidXe6jV1FU2I/edit?usp=sharing"}],"isQuote":false,"quoteBody":"","quoteAuthor":""},{"title":"PROJECT","subtitle":"Mines Interactive Campus Map","body":"The next time you have the chance, go visit the student center, and look around the main floor near the front desk.

Alex Pollock, a senior in the computer science department, and I built and designed the software for this interactive display all of fall semester. It was a part of an independent study project which I joined with Alex early in the semester--mostly by happenstance--but it ended up being a wonderful experience for me. I learned an incredibly large amount about web applications and also about software engineering in general. It also made me a better scientist, engineer, and creative thinker.

I had already developed quite an interest in wireless sensor systems, so I expressed this interest when we were discussing my next project. Dr. Han had a sabbatical planned in Italy to work on smart cities, so we thought that we might integrate my interests in wireless sensor networks with smart buildings and ways to improve them. From this, I began to identify some possible research questions, and one regarding relay node placement particularly struck me for its possible use in a practical environment. I began developing my sensors and microcontrollers for experimentation, and at the same time starting researching a new algorithm for relay node placement.

I passed the test and spent a few weeks on the Solidworks unit accordingly. Solidworks was a fantastic program, though it had a decent learning curve. After having spent some time with the program, we were given an assignment to model a chess board. I did some thumbnail sketches of what I wanted my pieces to look like, and after arriving on a design I enjoyed, I 3D modelled a set of chess pieces and two different chess boards (one plain and one with terrain). After switching back over to sketchup, we continued to model and generate ideas for our Module 4 design. This actually proved extremely useful to me and ended up being integrated with the final M4 design.

As some instructors may know, mind maps were one of the greatest concepts I took away from this class, and I tend to use them heavily. I find that they provide a visual representation of my process of thinking, and they often inspire me to come up with new and creative ideas. Accordingly, I thought it would be fitting to create one for my final portfolio! This mind map, being more of a visual spectacle than anything else, depicts the modules and what I took out of each one throughout my time in IDEAS. Of course, there are many interconnected components of the mind map, as certain ideas were reinforced throughout many modules.

I have never had any schooling or education in the area of biomimicry, and though I knew it existed, I had never used it in my own thinking or design. That is about to change though--I find the concept fascinating! Considering that natural phenomena have had millions if not billions of years to evolve and fit their purposes, finding ways to integrate them into design can truly make these designs more efficient and effective. In fact, it is in many ways surprising that the term did not become commonplace until recently, as it seems like a fairly obvious way to make designs more efficient, not to mention more aesthetically pleasing. I am glad that I had the opportunity to learn about such a concept in this class, as I find it unlikely that I would have had the chance in any other course. In my nature journal, I focused heavily on sketching plants like trees and flowers. I find these natural structures particularly unique because of their intrinsic connections to mathematics--specifically the fibonacci sequence--making them both beautiful and efficient organisms. Of course, I had to try coming up with some of my own naturally inspired mathematical experiments--so I tried creating various computer algorithms to generate structures based on fractals and the fibonacci sequence. I am happy with the way they turned out, and it is startling how similar they look to real natural structures. I did two of these designs in 2D, one using a structured mathematical algorithm and the other factoring in random numbers. Then, I did one 3D animation of a large fractal. It can be so easy to look right past a tree, missing the significance and complexity of its structure when there is perhaps much to learn from it!
